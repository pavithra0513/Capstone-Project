# Automated Resume Parsing Using Named Entity Recognition (NER) with NLP

## Introduction
Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a very important task in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) where the goal is to find and categorize entities, namely people, organizations, locations, dates, etc., within texts. Counting entity types in the NER provides a foundational element in information retrieval, question-answering systems, and content recommendation engines.

Real-world applications of NER can be best shown through the resume parsing domain. Today, organizations receive many resumes daily, which need to be sifted through to extract crucial information in order to cut down the time of the recruitment process. NER techniques are used to automatically identify and classify the important key entities from resumes such as:

- **Personal Information**: Names, contact details
- **Educational Background**: Degrees, institutions attended
- **Professional Experience**: Previous job titles, company names
- **Skills**: Technical proficiencies, languages

For research and development in this area, the Resume NER Dataset has been curated, containing a variety of resumes annotated with 36 different entity categories. This dataset is of great value to train and evaluate NER models for resume parsing applications. Using this dataset, developers can improve the functionality of automated systems by leveraging resume data more accurately and efficiently, enhancing talent acquisition workflow processes.
